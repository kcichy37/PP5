## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project was to build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Aim was to set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product

## Wireframes
- [Home page](readme_media/wireframe1.PNG) For the front page, not much has changed during the production from the original idea apart from some layout changes.
- [Menu](readme_media/wireframe2.PNG) The menu has stayed as planned from the beginning, however, I removed the checkout box as it was causing a lot of responsive issues with the menu cards
-[Checkout](readme_media/wireframe3.PNG) The check out has stayed true to the wireframe plan, a simple form with details of the order next to the form.
- A lot of desing change has happened during the building of the website as I was heavily influenced by a templated, but tried to stay with original desings.

## Agile Methodology
- While working on this project I used Agile tools provided by github such as the project board, which helped focus on prioritising and seeing what user stories are left to do, in progress or done.

- Another tool that I used was the Milestones that can be set in github, by creating the milestones I was able to group certain user stories together that worked along each other and allowed me to focus on particular side of the design
